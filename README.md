# About
A small and very simple BlackJack App ive made on my Scrimba Journey to become a professional Web Developer.
Ive changed the css and added two new functions.
ive added the bet() function which is called everytime the startGame() function gets called so 5 coins will be taken from the player.
then ive added a win() function as well which gets called if blackjack gets logged which adds ten coins to the player object.

you can check the app out here: https://astonishing-youtiao-0073d6.netlify.app/
